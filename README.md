## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 48exa, a Dutch developer studying Software Development.
I am a developer since 2021, I am fluent in English and my goals are:
 - [ ] Learn more language, especially low-level ones.
 - [x] Get decent at JS and basic front-end web development.
 - [ ] Get good at CSS positioning (a near impossible challenge).
 - [ ] Change my name so that I am able to share it online.

 My recent projects can be found in ***[my projects repository](https://github.com/48exa/projects)***
